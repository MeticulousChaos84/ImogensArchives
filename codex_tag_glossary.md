### Vault & Memories
- `#vault_memories` → Trial-specific, sealed Vault echoes.
- `#keymemories` → Domestic or personal anchors (wedding, pillow fights, stubborn optimism).
- `#pending` → Active arcs staged for Vaulting later.

### Lore & Worldbuilding
- `#netheril_lore` → Historical Netheril and its echoes.
- `#netherese_language` → Language hooks (Lithuanian stand-in, draconic script).
- `#custom_spells` → New spells, wards, and magical theory entries.

- `#TransitionPost` → Travel/world texture or narrative nudges.

## 🌌 Example Tag Stacks
- Erica’s wedding vow → `#keymemories #quotes #char/erica-jean`
- Therayn release → `#pending #vault_memories #netheril_lore`

## 🪶 Rule of Thumb
- Use **lowercase slugs** with dashes for names. 
- Stack tags for cross-reference (e.g., person + faction + theme).
- Keep ephemeral experiments in Project notes, not in tag canon.
