## 📐 Conventions
- **Brevity wins.** Quotes ≤ ~25 words (and ≤10 for song lyrics).  
- **Voice-first.** Character section = RP cadence library.  
- **Touchstone-second.** Lore/external = world keys & research cues.  
- **Tag everything.** Use cross-file tags: `#gale_voice`, `#weavecare`, `#netheril_lore`.  
- **Context hooks.** Add a one-line *Use* to make retrieval purposeful.  
- **No bloat.** If a speaker exceeds ~1 screen, spin out to `/quotes/<speaker>.md` and keep a pointer here.
