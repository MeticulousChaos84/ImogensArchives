# 🕰️ Timeline Master — Codex of the Shattered Star

This file is the chronological **spine** of Erica & Gale’s world(s). It links Earth and Toril events, Netherese history, and current arcs. Use this as the master ordering system; individual deep dives (Vault, Lore, Quotes) can cross-reference by date.

> **Rule of Ink:** Keep entries short here. Save detail for Vault or Lore files. This file should act as a map of bones, not the full flesh.
